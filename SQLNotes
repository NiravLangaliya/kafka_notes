Sure, here are some SQL interview questions at medium and hard levels, along with their answers. I've included questions related to the retail domain, customer, sales, inventory, and one question regarding time series data.

Medium Level Questions:
1. Retail Sales Analysis

Question:
You are given a dataset representing sales transactions in a retail store. The dataset contains information about the transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, purchase date, and quantity sold. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales amount for each product in the last month.

Sample Dataset:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    transaction_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    purchase_date DATE,
    quantity_sold INT
);

INSERT INTO Sales VALUES
(1, 101, 1, '2024-01-15', 2),
(2, 102, 2, '2024-02-05', 1),
(3, 103, 1, '2024-02-20', 3),
(4, 104, 3, '2024-02-28', 2);
Answer:

sql
Copy code
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM Sales
WHERE purchase_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY product_id;
2. Customer Ranking

Question:
In a retail store database, there's a table containing customer information including their name, total amount spent, and registration date. Write an SQL query to rank customers based on their total amount spent, and display their names along with their ranks.

Sample Dataset:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    total_amount_spent DECIMAL(10, 2),
    registration_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
(101, 'John', 500.00, '2023-01-10'),
(102, 'Alice', 750.00, '2023-03-20'),
(103, 'Bob', 1000.00, '2023-05-15'),
(104, 'Emma', 300.00, '2023-07-01');
Answer:

sql
Copy code
SELECT name, total_amount_spent,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_amount_spent DESC) AS rank
FROM Customers;
Hard Level Questions:
1. Inventory Management

Question:
You're managing inventory for a retail store. Write an SQL query to find out the products that are running low in stock, considering a threshold of 10 items. Display the product name, current stock quantity, and reorder level.

Sample Dataset:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    stock_quantity INT,
    reorder_level INT
);

INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 15, 10),
(2, 'Printer', 8, 10),
(3, 'Monitor', 20, 10),
(4, 'Keyboard', 12, 10);
Answer:

sql
Copy code
SELECT product_name, stock_quantity, reorder_level
FROM Products
WHERE stock_quantity <= reorder_level;
2. Time Series Analysis

Question:
You have a table storing daily sales data over the past year. Write an SQL query to calculate the average daily sales for each month, along with the month and year.

Sample Dataset:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE DailySales (
    sale_date DATE,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO DailySales VALUES
('2023-01-01', 100.00),
('2023-01-02', 120.00),
...
('2023-12-30', 150.00),
('2023-12-31', 180.00);
Answer:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS sales_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS sales_month,
    AVG(sales_amount) AS avg_daily_sales
FROM DailySales
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date);
These questions cover various aspects of SQL, including data analysis, ranking, inventory management, and time series analysis, while also focusing on the retail domain and customer-related data.

SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_revenue,
    DATEDIFF(MAX(t.transaction_date), c.registration_date) AS customer_lifetime,
    SUM(t.amount) / DATEDIFF(MAX(t.transaction_date), c.registration_date) AS CLV
FROM Customers c
JOIN Transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.registration_date;
2. Product Recommendations based on Customer Similarity

Question:
In a retail database, there are tables containing information about customers, their purchases, and the products they've bought. Write an SQL query to recommend products to customers based on the similarity of their purchase history with other customers. Consider recommending products that similar customers have bought but the current customer hasn't.

Sample Dataset:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Purchases (
    purchase_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT
);

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
(1, 'John'),
(2, 'Alice'),
(3, 'Bob');

INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(1, 'Laptop'),
(2, 'Printer'),
(3, 'Monitor');

INSERT INTO Purchases VALUES
(1, 1, 1),
(2, 1, 2),
(3, 2, 2),
(4, 3, 1),
(5, 3, 3);
Answer:

sql
Copy code
WITH CustomerProductCount AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
    FROM Purchases
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_id
),
SimilarCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        pc1.customer_id AS customer1,
        pc2.customer_id AS customer2,
        SUM(CASE WHEN pc1.product_id = pc2.product_id THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS similarity_score
    FROM CustomerProductCount pc1
    JOIN CustomerProductCount pc2 ON pc1.product_id = pc2.product_id
    WHERE pc1.customer_id != pc2.customer_id
    GROUP BY pc1.customer_id, pc2.customer_id
)
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name
FROM Customers c
CROSS JOIN Products p
LEFT JOIN Purchases pur ON c.customer_id = pur.customer_id AND p.product_id = pur.product_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        sc.customer1,
        sc.customer2,
        MAX(sc.similarity_score) AS max_similarity
    FROM SimilarCustomers sc
    GROUP BY sc.customer1
) max_sim ON c.customer_id = max_sim.customer1
WHERE pur.purchase_id IS NULL
AND max_sim.max_similarity >= 2; -- Adjust similarity threshold as needed
These hard/advanced level SQL questions delve into more complex scenarios such as calculating customer lifetime value (CLV) and performing product recommendations based on customer similarity. The answers provide detailed SQL queries to address these challenges, incorporating advanced SQL techniques like window functions and common table expressions (CTEs).

Can you create a sample questions around data structure and around common data engineer problems with  medium and hard level  complexity and also provide  solution in python and scala 

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some sample questions around data structures and common data engineering problems, along with their solutions in both Python and Scala.

Medium Level Question:
1. Data Structure: Implement a Stack

Question:
Implement a stack data structure that supports the following operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack and return it.
Peek: Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
IsEmpty: Return True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
Solution in Python:

python
Copy code
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val):
        self.stack.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

# Usage:
s = Stack()
s.push(1)
s.push(2)
print(s.peek())  # Output: 2
print(s.pop())   # Output: 2
print(s.is_empty())  # Output: False
Solution in Scala:

scala
Copy code
class Stack {
  var stack: List[Int] = List()

  def push(value: Int): Unit = {
    stack = value :: stack
  }

  def pop(): Option[Int] = {
    if (!isEmpty()) {
      val top = stack.head
      stack = stack.tail
      Some(top)
    } else {
      None
    }
  }

  def peek(): Option[Int] = {
    if (!isEmpty()) {
      Some(stack.head)
    } else {
      None
    }
  }

  def isEmpty(): Boolean = {
    stack.isEmpty
  }
}

// Usage:
val s = new Stack
s.push(1)
s.push(2)
println(s.peek())  // Output: Some(2)
println(s.pop())   // Output: Some(2)
println(s.isEmpty())  // Output: false
Hard Level Question:
2. Data Engineering: Find Common Elements in Two Large Datasets

Question:
You have two large datasets stored in separate files, each containing millions of records. Write a program to find common elements between these datasets efficiently.

Solution in Python:

python
Copy code
def find_common_elements(file1, file2):
    common_elements = set()
    with open(file1, 'r') as f1:
        for line in f1:
            common_elements.add(line.strip())
    with open(file2, 'r') as f2:
        for line in f2:
            element = line.strip()
            if element in common_elements:
                print(element)

# Usage:
file1 = 'dataset1.txt'
file2 = 'dataset2.txt'
find_common_elements(file1, file2)
Solution in Scala:

scala
Copy code
import scala.io.Source

def findCommonElements(file1: String, file2: String): Unit = {
  val set1 = Source.fromFile(file1).getLines.toSet
  val set2 = Source.fromFile(file2).getLines.toSet
  val commonElements = set1.intersect(set2)
  commonElements.foreach(println)
}

// Usage:
val file1 = "dataset1.txt"
val file2 = "dataset2.txt"
findCommonElements(file1, file2)
These questions and solutions demonstrate a medium-level question focusing on implementing a stack data structure and a hard-level question related to data engineering, requiring efficient processing of large datasets to find common elements. The solutions are provided in both Python and Scala to showcase different approaches in these languages.
